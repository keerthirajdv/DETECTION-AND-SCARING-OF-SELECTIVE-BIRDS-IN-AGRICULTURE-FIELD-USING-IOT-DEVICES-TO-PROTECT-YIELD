# DETECTION AND SCARING OF SELECTIVE BIRDS IN AGRICULTURE FIELD USING IOT DEVICES
Detection and scaring of selective birds in agriculture field using IOT devices to protect
yield" is an innovative project designed to mitigate crop damage caused by birds through the
integration of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.
Birds, while beneficial to ecosystems, often pose a significant threat to agricultural fields,
leading to considerable economic losses for farmers. Traditional bird deterrent methods, such
as scarecrows and noise makers, frequently fail to maintain their effectiveness over time as
birds adapt to them. This project addresses this challenge by deploying a smart, automated
system capable of detecting and selectively deterring specific bird species that threaten crops.
# System Components
1. YOLO Object Detection:
 - Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time detection of birds using a webcam
feed.
 - Known for its high speed and accuracy, making it suitable for continuous monitoring.
2. ResNet100-based CNN Classification:
 - Employs a ResNet100-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify detected
birds into harmful and harmless species.
 - Ensures targeted deterrence, minimizing unnecessary disturbance to non-threatening
wildlife.
3. Real-Time Monitoring:
 - Continuous monitoring of the agricultural field via a webcam, providing a live feed for
detection and classification.
4. Automated Alert System:
 - Sends instant notifications to users through the Blynk platform when a harmful bird is
detected.
 - Notifications can be customized to be received via mobile apps or emails.
5. Bird Deterrence Mechanism:
 - A buzzer connected to an ESP32 board is activated to emit sounds designed to scare away
detected harmful birds.
 - Control algorithms ensure the buzzer is only activated for harmful species, enhancing
efficiency.
6. IoT Integration:
 - The ESP32 board manages the buzzer and handles communication with the Blynk server,
ensuring reliable and low-latency responses.

# CONCLUSION
"Detection and scaring of selective birds in agriculture field using IOT
devices to protect yield" not only addresses the limitations of traditional bird deterrence
methods but also introduces a sophisticated, efficient, and sustainable approach to protecting
crops. This project exemplifies the transformative potential of AI and IoT in solving real-world
agricultural challenges, ultimately contributing to increased agricultural productivity and
sustainability. Through this innovative solution, farmers can effectively safeguard their crops,
reduce economic losses, and promote more sustainable farming practices.
# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
The "Detection and scaring of selective birds in agriculture field using IOT devices to protect
yield" lays a strong foundation for advanced agricultural protection, but there are several areas
where future enhancements could significantly improve its performance and adaptability. One
potential enhancement involves integrating additional sensors, such as thermal cameras and
acoustic sensors. Thermal cameras would enable the system to detect birds in low-light
conditions or at night, where traditional cameras may struggle. Acoustic sensors could capture
bird calls and combine acoustic data with visual inputs, leading to more accurate detection and
classification of bird species.
